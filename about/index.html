			<br>
			<b>Trained model performance on unseen/test data:</b>

			<br>
			Note: 
			1. Trained on very few samples for demonstration purpose only
			2. The sample data represents sneeze and cough audio data along with regular sounds to learn the variations.
			3. Training on actual COVID Cough, Breathing Sounds can yield real-time feedback to monitor patients' healh conditions from the Cough type classification AI Models.
