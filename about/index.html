			<br>
			<b>Trained model performance on unseen/test data:</b>

			<br>
			Note: 
			<br>
			1. Trained on very few samples for demonstration purpose only
			<br>
			2. The sample data represents sneeze and cough audio data along with regular sounds to learn the variations.
			<br>
			3. Training on actual COVID Cough, Breathing Sounds can yield real-time feedback to monitor patients' healh conditions from the Cough type classification AI Models.
